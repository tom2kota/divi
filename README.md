Once you have downloaded the theme builder pack, locate the divi-theme-builder-pack-1.zip file in your downloads folder on your computer. Double click the folder to unzip it and then navigate inside the divi-theme-builder-pack-1 folder. Inside this folder, you will find one file that contains all the different templates and an individual file for each separate template as well.

To upload the Theme Builder Pack to your website, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Divi > Theme Builder. You can select the individual layout you desire or choose the ‘all’ file to important everything at once.

    theme-builder-pack-1-all.json
    theme-builder-pack-1-default-website-template.json
    theme-builder-pack-1-product-page-template.json
    theme-builder-pack-1-post-template.json
    theme-builder-pack-1-category-page-template.json
    theme-builder-pack-1-404-page-template.json


Important: when you import the files without unchecking the boxes, the templates will automatically affect your entire website. Make sure you double-check these options before uploading a file.

The photos included with these templates have no licensing restrictions. This means you can use them in all of your commercial projects without having to worry about paying licensing fees or attributing the photographer. Use them in your commercial websites, sell them within your Divi child themes, include them in your own Divi layout packs or just use them on your blog. We know how challenging it can be to find good photos and how confusing and scary the licensing that governs those photos can be. We want to fix that problem for our users.
